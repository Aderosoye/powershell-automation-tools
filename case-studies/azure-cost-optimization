# Case Study: Optimizing Azure Spend for a 50-User Tech Company

## 📌 Problem
A mid-sized tech company was experiencing rapidly increasing Azure bills with no clear visibility into cost drivers. They lacked automation or any cost governance structure.

## 🛠 Solution
- Audited Azure subscriptions using **Cost Management** and **PowerShell**
- Created a custom dashboard with:
  - Budgets & forecast alerts
  - Resource usage breakdown
  - Monthly reporting automation
- Applied **Azure Advisor** suggestions
- Implemented auto-shutdown rules for unused VMs

## 🔁 Sample PowerShell Task
```powershell
# Get Azure Cost Breakdown
Get-AzConsumptionUsageDetail -StartDate "2024-01-01" -EndDate "2024-01-31" |
Group-Object -Property MeterCategory |
Select-Object Name, @{Name="TotalCost";Expression={($_.Group | Measure-Object -Property PretaxCost -Sum).Sum}}
